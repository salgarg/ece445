# 2022-08-29: Meeting with Alice and Jack

- In this meeting, our objectives were to introduce ourselves to each other and talk about project ideas for the semester, as well as our technical backgrounds. We discussed the project ideas posted on the web board by Alice and Jack, including a remotely adjusted cast similar which would essentially add remote capabilities to existing AirCasts and a phone case that converts energy generated by a crank to charge the phone. I learned that Alice has experience with frontend software development, and Jack has experience working in networking and with microcontrollers.
