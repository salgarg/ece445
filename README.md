# 2022-08-29: Meeting with Alice and Jack

- In this meeting, our objectives were to introduce ourselves to each other and talk about project ideas for the semester, as well as our technical backgrounds. We discussed the project ideas posted on the web board by Alice and Jack, including a remotely adjusted cast similar which would essentially add remote capabilities to existing AirCasts and a phone case that converts energy generated by a crank to charge the phone. I learned that Alice has experience with frontend software development, and Jack has experience working in networking and with microcontrollers. 

# 2022-09-11: Project Proposal Draft with Alice and Jack

- In this meeting, I met with Alice and Jack to discuss our project proposal, which is due this upcoming Thursday and will be minorly reviewed by our TA during class time on Tuesday. We worked together to come up with the 3 high-level requirements associated with our project. Along with this, we worked together on LucidChart to develop the block diagram of our project components. We want to confirm that we did this correctly and remembered to include everything necessary when we meet with our TA on Tuesday (2022-09-13). We also split up which portion of the ethics and safety section of the proposal that we would each work on, hoping to have all of it done by Tuesday or Wednesday so that we can discuss our proposal overall before the deadline on Thursday.

## First Draft of Block Diagram:

# 2022-13-09: First meeting with TA

- Alice, Jack, and I met with our assigned TA for the fist time, to introduce ourselves, go over our project proposal draft, and get some tips on how to move forward with our proposal before the deadline. We showed our TA which microcontroller we were thinking about using: https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400, and he explained to us that we would have to purchase just the microcontroller portion of this, and that we should avoid de-soldering it to extract that component. We found the component being sold separately here: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3320.

# 2022-15-09: Project Proposal cont. with Alice & Jack

- Discussed and researched which microcontroller to use for our project and finalized ESP32 from Adafruit - as it has bluetooth capabilities too + was discussed in first meeting with TA as a common choice
- Discussed the requirements we should have for each subsystem and how to qualify/quantify them for the project proposal write-up
- Discussed how to come up with a mathematical analysis which we could apply to our risk tolerance analysis. We emailed the TA to see about how we could approach this and he suggested calculating the torque of the motor needed to adjust the strap tightness on the cast, and proving that this is possible with the motor we wanted to utilize. After doing some more research on types of motors we could use, we found one that sounded reasonable and performed the necessary calcualtions. In addition to this, Jack added a portion to the risk tolerance analysis regarding the stretch risk of the system's pressure module. He did the research and calculations for this part as well to prove the pressure module will work with our procedure.
- Finalized our block diagram as per the TA's suggestions
