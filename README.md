# 2022-08-29: Meeting with Alice and Jack

- In this meeting, our objectives were to introduce ourselves to each other and talk about project ideas for the semester, as well as our technical backgrounds. We discussed the project ideas posted on the web board by Alice and Jack, including a remotely adjusted cast similar which would essentially add remote capabilities to existing AirCasts and a phone case that converts energy generated by a crank to charge the phone. I learned that Alice has experience with frontend software development, and Jack has experience working in networking and with microcontrollers. 

# 2022-09-11: Project Proposal Draft with Alice and Jack

- In this meeting, I met with Alice and Jack to discuss our project proposal, which is due this upcoming Thursday and will be minorly reviewed by our TA during class time on Tuesday. We worked together to come up with the 3 high-level requirements associated with our project. Along with this, we worked together on LucidChart to develop the block diagram of our project components. We want to confirm that we did this correctly and remembered to include everything necessary when we meet with our TA on Tuesday (2022-09-13). We also split up which portion of the ethics and safety section of the proposal that we would each work on, hoping to have all of it done by Tuesday or Wednesday so that we can discuss our proposal overall before the deadline on Thursday.
